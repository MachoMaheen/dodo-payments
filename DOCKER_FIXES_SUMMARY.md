# Docker Build Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix Docker build issues in the Dodo Payments application.

## Root Causes

1. **SQLx Compilation Issues**: SQLx was trying to validate SQL queries at compile time but couldn't connect to a database during Docker build.
2. **BigDecimal Serialization**: Missing `serde` feature with the correct version of BigDecimal.
3. **Transaction Syntax Errors**: Using `&mut tx` instead of `&mut *tx` or `&tx` in SQLx 0.7.x.
4. **Model Structure Inconsistencies**: Different versions of structures between the original and fixed versions.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Cargo.toml**:

   - Ensured `bigdecimal` dependency has the correct version with `serde` feature enabled
   - Added `migrate` feature to SQLx

2. **Updated Model Structures**:

   - Fixed `TransactionListResponse` to include pagination fields
   - Added conversion helpers for BigDecimal serialization

3. **Handler Fixes**:

   - Updated transaction handlers to use runtime queries instead of macros
   - Fixed the transaction handling syntax to work with SQLx 0.7.x
   - Added Row trait import where needed

4. **Docker Configuration**:

   - Confirmed Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have `SQLX_OFFLINE=false`

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `use_runtime_queries.md` with comprehensive guidance
   - Added helper scripts for building and running with Docker

## Running the Fixed Application

Use the new scripts to build and run the application with Docker:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
./build-and-run-docker.sh

# For Windows
build-and-run-docker.bat
```

The application should now build and run correctly in Docker, with all queries executing at runtime instead of being checked at compile time.
